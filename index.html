This blog serves to document my work during the period of my GSoC 2020 project, **TMVA Interfaces PyTorch** in **ROOT/TMVA** at **CERN**.

The **[Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA)](https://root.cern.ch/tmva)** is a **machine learning** environment integrated into the **[ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/)** scientific software framework, which has been developed specifically for **high-energy physics** applications.

TMVA provides functionality for building **deep neural networks** including fully connected, convolutional and recurrent layers. In addition, TMVA provides interfaces to other deep learning frameworks (scikit-learn, Keras). This project aims to extend these interfaces to one of the most popular, fast and flexible machine learning frameworks, **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)**. The focus will be on the development of a production-ready TMVA interface to PyTorch, while strictly adhering to my **[proposal](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b54yrngOjth9wUiS7iAg_rEm7J2J749d)**.
