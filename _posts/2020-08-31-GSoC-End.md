> TLDR: It feels unbelievable to have contributed to CERN as a GSoC student. My contributions can be found at [#5757](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/5757) and [#6273](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/6273).

# Journey

Summer of 2020 has been nothing short of a roller-coaster ride filled with challenges and obstacles. I feel a sense of achievement looking back at the work I managed to complete while hitting my goals and targets in these trying times. Ever since my first pull request got merged, I have been longing to create an impact with open-source contributions. Thanks to CERN-HSF and Google Summer Of Code for providing me an opportunity to work on the **ROOT TMVA** framework which provides a machine learning environment for the modelling, processing, and evaluation of high-energy physics data.

Let me take you through the work I've carried out this summer.

During these three months, I developed a PyTorch Interface for TMVA. Hopefully, users and developers will utilize the newest addition to the TMVA family.
