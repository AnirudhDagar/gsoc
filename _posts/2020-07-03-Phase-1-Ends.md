# Progress

This is a short update on my progress till the Phase 1 Evaluations in GSoC 2020. The following goals were set for the 1st month according to my proposal, of which I was able to complete the following.

**Header MethodPyTorch**
- [x] Add Initial Structure for `MethodPyTorch.h` header file.

**Class MethodPyTorch**
Implement the basic outline of `MethodPyTorch.cxx` Class.

- [x] Implement the `DeclareOptions` method
- [x] Implement `ProcessOptions` method
- [x] Implement `SetupTorchModel` method
- [x] Implement Validation Sample Splits
- [ ] Implement train methods. (Could not complete)
    - [x] Implement simple basic structure for training
    - [ ] Add ability to load code from users
    - [x] Convert numpy based dataloaders in TMVA to PyTorch dataloaders
    - [ ] Use default optimizer (optional optimizer SGD)
    - [ ] Add savebest model
    - [ ] Add scheduler
- [x] Implement `helper` function

The `train` method in the `MethodPyTorch` requires a few more preliminary options which will facilitate loading user code into the TMVA Interface, but it's not implemented in PyMVA yet. Lorenzo (my mentor) is working on a solution for that exact problem and as soon as that is fixed, I should be able to implement the train method.


Hopefully, I'll get this done in the next couple of weeks!ðŸ¤ž
