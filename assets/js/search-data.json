            "content": "What Superpowers? . Hi, I’m Hamel Husain. I’m a machine learning engineer at GitHub. Recently, GitHub released a new product called GitHub Actions, which has mostly flown under the radar in the machine learning and data science community as just another continuous integration tool. . Recently, I’ve been able to use GitHub Actions to build some very unique tools for Data Scientists, which I want to share with you today. Most importantly, I hope to get you excited about GitHub Actions, and the promise it has for giving you new superpowers as a Data Scientist. Here are two projects I recently built with Actions that show off its potential: . fastpages . fastpages is an automated, open-source blogging platform with enhanced support for Jupyter notebooks. You save your notebooks, markdown, or Word docs into a directory on GitHub, and they automatically become blog posts. Read the announcement below: . We&#39;re launching `fastpages`, a platform which allows you to host a blog for free, with no ads. You can blog with @ProjectJupyter notebooks, @office Word, directly from @github&#39;s markdown editor, etc.Nothing to install, &amp; setup is automated!https://t.co/dNSA0oQUrN . &mdash; Jeremy #Masks4All Howard (@jeremyphoward) February 24, 2020 Machine Learning Ops . Wouldn’t it be cool if you could invoke a chatbot natively on GitHub to test your machine learning models on the infrastructure of your choice (GPUs), log all the results, and give you a rich report back in a pull request so that everyone could see the results? You can with GitHub Actions! . Consider the below annotated screenshot of this Pull Request: . . A more in-depth explanation about the above project can be viewed in this video: . Using GitHub Actions for machine learning workflows is starting to catch on. Julien Chaumond, CTO of Hugging Face, says: . GitHub Actions are great because they let us do CI on GPUs (as most of our users use the library on GPUs not on CPUs), on our own infra! 1 . Additionally, you can host a GitHub Action for other people so others can use parts of your workflow without having to re-create your steps. I provide examples of this below. . A Gentle Introduction To GitHub Actions . What Are GitHub Actions? . GitHub Actions allow you to run arbitrary code in response to events. Events are activities that happen on GitHub such as: . Opening a pull request | Making an issue comment | Labeling an issue | Creating a new branch | … and many more | . When an event is created, the GitHub Actions context is hydrated with a payload containing metadata for that event. Below is an example of a payload that is received when an issue is created: . { &quot;action&quot;: &quot;created&quot;, &quot;issue&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: 444500041, &quot;number&quot;: 1, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Spelling error in the README file&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: { &quot;login&quot;: &quot;Codertocat&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;User&quot;, }, &quot;labels&quot;: [ { &quot;id&quot;: 1362934389, &quot;node_id&quot;: &quot;MDU6TGFiZWwxMzYyOTM0Mzg5&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bug&quot;, } ], &quot;body&quot;: &quot;It looks like you accidently spelled &#39;commit&#39; with two &#39;t&#39;s.&quot; } . This functionality allows you to respond to various events on GitHub in an automated way. In addition to this payload, GitHub Actions also provide a plethora of variables and environment variables that afford easy to access metadata such as the username and the owner of the repo. Additionally, other people can package useful functionality into an Action that other people can inherit. For example, consider the below Action that helps you publish python packages to PyPi: . The Usage section describes how this Action can be used: . - name: Publish a Python distribution to PyPI uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@master with: user: __token__ password: ${{ secrets.pypi_password }} . This Action expects two inputs: user and a password. You will notice that the password is referencing a variable called secrets, which is a variable that contains an encrypted secret that you can upload to your GitHub repository. There are thousands of Actions (that are free) for a wide variety of tasks that can be discovered on the GitHub Marketplace. The ability to inherit ready-made Actions in your workflow allows you to accomplish complex tasks without implementing all of the logic yourself. Some useful Actions for those getting started are: . actions/checkout: Allows you to quickly clone the contents of your repository into your environment, which you often want to do. This does a number of other things such as automatically mount your repository’s files into downstream Docker containers. | mxschmitt/action-tmate: Proivdes a way to debug Actions interactively. This uses port forwarding to give you a terminal in the browser that is connected to your Actions runner. Be careful not to expose sensitive information if you use this. | actions/github-script: Gives you a pre-authenticated ocotokit.js client that allows you to interact with the GitHub API to accomplish almost any task on GitHub automatically. Only these endpoints are supported (for example, the secrets endpoint is not in that list). | . In addition to the aforementioned Actions, it is helpful to go peruse the official GitHub Actions docs before diving in. . Example: A fastpages Action Workflow . The best to way familiarize yourself with Actions is by studying examples. Let’s take a look at the Action workflow that automates the build of fastpages (the platform used to write this blog post). . Part 1: Define Workflow Triggers . blog, defined in ci.yaml. Like all Actions workflows, this is YAML file is located in the .github/workflows directory of the GitHub repo. . The top of this YAML file looks like this: . name: CI on: push: branches: - master pull_request: . This means that this workflow is triggered on either a push or pull request event. Furthermore, push events are filtered such that only pushes to the master branch will trigger the workflow, whereas all pull requests will trigger this workflow. It is important to note that pull requests opened from forks will have read-only access to the base repository and cannot access any secrets for security reasons. The reason for defining the workflow in this way is we wanted to trigger the same workflow to test pull requests as well as build and deploy the website when a PR is merged into master. This will be clarified as we step through the rest of the YAML file. . Part 2: Define Jobs . Next, we define jobs (there is only one in this workflow). Per the docs: . A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs. Jobs run in parallel by default. . jobs: build-site: if: ( github.event.commits[0].message != &#39;Initial commit&#39; ) || github.run_number &gt; 1 runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: . The keyword build-site is the name of your job and you can name it whatever you want. In this case, we have a conditional if statement that dictates if this job should be run or not. We are trying to ensure that this workflow does not run when the first commit to a repo is made with the message ‘Initial commit’. The first variable in the if statement, github.event, contains a json payload of the event that triggered this workflow. When developing workflows, it is helpful to print this variable in order to inspect its structure, which you can accomplish with the following YAML: . - name: see payload run: | echo &quot;PAYLOAD: n${PAYLOAD} n&quot; env: PAYLOAD: ${{ toJSON(github.event) }} . Note: the above step is only for debugging and is not currently in the workflow. . toJson is a handy function that returns a pretty-printed JSON representation of the variable. The output is printed directly in the logs contained in the Actions tab of your repo. In this example, printing the payload for a push event will look like this (truncated for brevity): . { &quot;ref&quot;: &quot;refs/tags/simple-tag&quot;, &quot;before&quot;: &quot;6113728f27ae8c7b1a77c8d03f9ed6e0adf246&quot;, &quot;created&quot;: false, &quot;deleted&quot;: true, &quot;forced&quot;: false, &quot;base_ref&quot;: null, &quot;commits&quot;: [ { &quot;message&quot;: &quot;updated README.md&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;hamelsmu&quot; }, ], &quot;head_commit&quot;: null, } . Therefore, the variable github.event.commits[0].message will retrieve the first commit message in the array of commits. Since we are looking for situations where there is only one commit, this logic suffices. The second variable in the if statement, github.run_number is a special variable in Actions which: . [is a] unique number for each run of a particular workflow in a repository. This number begins at 1 for the workflow’s first run, and increments with each new run. This number does not change if you re-run the workflow run. . Therefore, the if statement introduced above: . if: ( github.event.commits[0].message != &#39;Initial commit&#39; ) || github.run_number &gt; 1 . Allows the workflow to run when the commit message is “Initial commit” as long as it is not the first commit. ( || is a logical or operator). . Finally, the line runs-on: ubuntu-latest specifies the host operating system that your workflows will run in. . Part 3: Define Steps . Per the docs: . A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps. Steps can run commands, run setup tasks, or run an Action in your repository, a public repository, or an Action published in a Docker registry. Not all steps run Actions, but all Actions run as a step. Each step runs in its own process in the runner environment and has access to the workspace and filesystem. Because steps run in their own process, changes to environment variables are not preserved between steps. GitHub provides built-in steps to set up and complete a job. . Below are the first two steps in our workflow: . - name: Copy Repository Contents uses: actions/checkout@master with: persist-credentials: false - name: convert notebooks and word docs to posts uses: ./_action_files . The first step creates a copy of your repository in the Actions file system, with the help of the utility action/checkout. This utility only fetches the last commit by default and saves files into a directory (whose path is stored in the environment variable GITHUB_WORKSPACE that is accessible by subsequent steps in your job. The second step runs the fastai/fastpages Action, which converts notebooks and word documents to blog posts automatically. In this case, the syntax: . uses: ./_action_files . is a special case where the pre-made GitHub Action we want to run happens to be defined in the same repo that runs this workflow. This syntax allows us to test changes to this pre-made Action when evaluating PRs by referencing the directory in the current repository that defines that pre-made Action. Note: Building pre-made Actions is beyond the scope of this tutorial. . The next three steps in our workflow are defined below: . - name: setup directories for Jekyll build run: | rm -rf _site sudo chmod -R 777 . - name: Jekyll build uses: docker://hamelsmu/fastpages-jekyll with: args: bash -c &quot;gem install bundler &amp;&amp; jekyll build -V&quot; env: JEKYLL_ENV: &#39;production&#39; - name: copy CNAME file into _site if CNAME exists run: | sudo chmod -R 777 _site/ cp CNAME _site/ 2&gt;/dev/null || : . The step named setup directories for Jekyll build executes shell commands that remove the _site folder in order to get rid of stale files related to the page we want to build, as well as grant permissions to all the files in our repo to subsequent steps. . The step named Jekyll build executes a docker container hosted by the Jekyll community on Dockerhub called jekyll/jekyll. For those not familiar with Docker, see this tutorial. The name of this container is called hamelsmu/fastpages-jekyll because I’m adding some additional dependencies to jekyll/jekyll and hosting those on my DockerHub account for faster build times2. The args parameter allows you to execute arbitrary commands with the Docker container by overriding the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile. We use this Docker container hosted on Dockerhub so we don’t have to deal with installing and configuring all of the complicated dependencies for Jekyll. The files from our repo are already available in the Actions runtime due to the first step in this workflow, and are mounted into this Docker container automatically for us. In this case, we are running the command jekyll build, which builds our website and places relevant assets them into the _site folder. For more information about Jekyll, read the official docs. Finally, the env parameter allows me to pass an environment variable into the Docker container. . The final command above copies a CNAME file into the _site folder, which we need for the custom domain https://fastpages.fast.ai. Setting up custom domains are outside the scope of this article. . The final step in our workflow is defined below: . - name: Deploy if: github.event_name == &#39;push&#39; uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: deploy_key: ${{ secrets.SSH_DEPLOY_KEY }} publish_dir: ./_site . The statement . if: github.event_name == &#39;push&#39; . uses the variable github.event_name to ensure this step only runs when a push event ( in this case only pushes to the master branch trigger this workflow) occur. . This step deploys the fastpages website by copying the contents of the _site folder to the root of the gh-pages branch, which GitHub Pages uses for hosting. This step uses the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages Action, pinned at version 3. Their README describes various options and inputs for this Action. . Conclusion . We hope that this has shed some light on how we use GitHub Actions to automate fastpages. While we only covered one workflow above, we hope this provides enough intuition to understand the other workflows in fastpages. We have only scratched the surface of GitHub Actions in this blog post, but we provide other materials below for those who want to dive in deeper. We have not covered how to host an Action for other people, but you can start with these docs to learn more. . Still confused about how GitHub Actions could be used for Data Science?

            "title": "Introducing fastpages",
            "content": ". We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of fastpages. fastpages is a platform which allows you to create and host a blog for free, with no ads and many useful features, such as: . Create posts containing code, outputs of code (which can be interactive), formatted text, etc directly from Jupyter Notebooks; for instance see this great example post from Scott Hawley. Notebook posts support features such as: Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive. | Hide or show cell input and output. | Collapsable code cells that are either open or closed by default. | Define the Title, Summary and other metadata via a special markdown cells | Ability to add links to Colab and GitHub automatically. | . | Create posts, including formatting and images, directly from Microsoft Word documents. | Create and edit Markdown posts entirely online using GitHub&#39;s built-in markdown editor. | Embed Twitter cards and YouTube videos. | Categorization of blog posts by user-supplied tags for discoverability. | ... and much more | . fastpages relies on Github pages for hosting, and Github Actions to automate the creation of your blog. The setup takes around three minutes, and does not require any technical knowledge or expertise. Due to built-in automation of fastpages, you don&#39;t have to fuss with conversion scripts. All you have to do is save your Jupyter notebook, Word document or markdown file into a specified directory and the rest happens automatically. Infact, this blog post is written in a Jupyter notebook, which you can see with the &quot;View on GitHub&quot; link above. . fast.ai have previously released a similar project called fast_template, which is even easier to set up, but does not support automatic creation of posts from Microsoft Word or Jupyter notebooks, including many of the features outlined above. . Because fastpages is more flexible and extensible, we recommend using it where possible. fast_template may be a better option for getting folks blogging who have no technical expertise at all, and will only be creating posts using Github&#39;s integrated online editor. . Setting Up Fastpages . The setup process of fastpages is automated with GitHub Actions, too! Upon creating a repo from the fastpages template, a pull request will automatically be opened (after ~ 30 seconds) configuring your blog so it can start working. The automated pull request will greet you with instructions like this: . . All you have to do is follow these instructions (in the PR you receive) and your new blogging site will be up and running! . Jupyter Notebooks &amp; Fastpages . In this post, we will cover special features that fastpages provides has for Jupyter notebooks. You can also write your blog posts with Word documents or markdown in fastpages, which contain many, but not all the same features. . Options via FrontMatter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . All of the above settings are enabled in this post, so you can see what they look like! . the summary field (preceeded by &gt;) will be displayed under your title, and will also be used by social media to display as the description of your page. | toc: setting this to true will automatically generate a table of contents | badges: setting this to true will display Google Colab and GitHub links on your blog post. | comments: setting this to true will enable comments. See these instructions for more details. | author this will display the authors names. | categories will allow your post to be categorized on a &quot;Tags&quot; page, where readers can browse your post by categories. | . Markdown front matter is formatted similarly to notebooks. The differences between the two can be viewed on the fastpages README. . Code Folding . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

How fastpages Converts Notebooks to Blog Posts . fastpages uses nbdev to power the conversion process of Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts. When you save a notebook into the /_notebooks folder of your repository, GitHub Actions applies nbdev against those notebooks automatically. The same process occurs when you save Word documents or markdown files into the _word or _posts directory, respectively. . We will discuss how GitHub Actions work in a follow up blog post. . Resources &amp; Next Steps . We highly encourage you to start blogging with fastpages! Some resources that may be helpful: . fastpages repo - this is where you can go to create your own fastpages blog! | Fastai forums - nbdev &amp; blogging category.

There is minimal support for Word documents in fastpages compared to Jupyter notebooks. Some known limitations: . alt text in Word documents are not yet supported by fastpages, and will break links to images. . | You can only specify front matter for Word documents globally. See the README for more details. . | . For greater control over the content produced from Word documents, you will need to convert Word to markdown files manually. You can follow the steps in this blog post, which walk you through how to use pandoc to do the conversion. Note: If you wish to customize your Word generated blog post in markdown, make sure you delete your Word document from the _word directory so your markdown file doesn’t get overwritten! . If your primary method of writing blog posts is Word documents, and you plan on always manually editing Word generated markdown files, you are probably better off using fast_template instead of fastpages. . The material below is a reproduction of this blog post, and serves as an illustrative example. . Maintaining a healthy open source project can entail a huge amount of toil. Popular projects often have orders of magnitude more users and episodic contributors opening issues and PRs than core maintainers capable of handling these issues. . Consider this graphic prepared by the NumFOCUS foundation showing the number of maintainers for three widely used scientific computing projects: . . We can see that across these three projects, there is a very low ratio maintainers to users. Fixing this problem is not an easy task and likely requires innovative solutions to address the economics as well as tools. . Due to its recent momentum and popularity, Kubeflow suffers from a similar fate as illustrated by the growth of new issues opened: . . Source: “TensorFlow World 2019, Automating Your Developer Workflow With ML” . Coincidentally, while building out end to end machine learning examples for Kubeflow, we built two examples using publicly available GitHub data: GitHub Issue Summarization and Code Search. While these tutorials were useful for demonstrating components of Kubeflow, we realized that we could take this a step further and build concrete data products that reduce toil for maintainers. . This is why we started the project kubeflow/code-intelligence, with the goals of increasing project velocity and health using data driven tools. Below are two projects we are currently experimenting with : . Issue Label Bot: This is a bot that automatically labels GitHub issues using Machine Learning. This bot is a GitHub App that was originally built for Kubeflow but is now also used by several large open source projects. The current version of this bot only applies a very limited set of labels, however we are currently A/B testing new models that allow personalized labels. Here is a blog post discussing this project in more detail. . | Issue Triage GitHub Action: to compliment the Issue Label Bot, we created a GitHub Action that automatically adds / removes Issues to the Kubeflow project board tracking issues needing triage. . | Together these projects allow us to reduce the toil of triaging issues. The GitHub Action makes it much easier for the Kubeflow maintainers to track issues needing triage. With the label bot we have taken the first steps in using ML to replace human intervention. We plan on using features extracted by ML to automate more steps in the triage process to further reduce toil. . Building Solutions with GitHub Actions . One of the premises of Kubeflow is that a barrier to building data driven, ML powered solutions is getting models into production and integrated into a solution. In the case of building models to improve OSS project health, that often means integrating with GitHub where the project is hosted. . We are really excited by GitHub’s newly released feature GitHub Actions because we think it will make integrating ML with GitHub much easier. . For simple scripts, like the issue triage script, GitHub actions make it easy to automate executing the script in response to GitHub events without having to build and host a GitHub app. . To automate adding/removing issues needing triage to a Kanban board we wrote a simple python script that interfaces with GitHub’s GraphQL API to modify issues. . As we continue to iterate on ML Models to further reduce toil, GitHub Actions will make it easy to leverage Kubeflow to put our models into production faster. A number of prebuilt GitHub Actions make it easy to create Kubernetes resources in response to GitHub events. For example, we have created GitHub Actions to launch Argo Workflows. This means once we have a Kubernetes job or workflow to perform inference we can easily integrate the model with GitHub and have the full power of Kubeflow and Kubernetes (eg. GPUs). We expect this will allow us to iterate much faster compared to building and maintaining GitHub Apps. . Call To Action . We have a lot more work to do in order to achieve our goal of reducing the amount of toil involved in maintaining OSS projects. If your interested in helping out here’s a couple of issues to get started: . Help us create reports that pull and visualize key performance indicators (KPI). https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence/issues/71 . We have defined our KPI here: issue #19 | . | Combine repo specific and non-repo specific label predictions: https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence/issues/70 . | . In addition to the aforementioned issues we welcome contributions for these other issues in our repo. .",
